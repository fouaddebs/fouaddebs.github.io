      <description>Introduction With the NFL season in full swing, my obsession with fantasy football has never been stronger. In this project, I will look for any relationships between fantasy football performance and player total contract amount. My first dataset is titled &amp;quot;Football players salaries&amp;quot; and was found on Kaggle. This dataset includes details on NFL players&#39; contracts, including total value, guaranteed money, salary, and player age. My second dataset is titled &amp;quot;Fantasy Football Stats and Season Leaders&amp;quot; and was provided by FantasyData.</description>
