      <description>This semester, we have been almost exclusively working in R studio, as we conducted projects and learned how to code in R. Recently, I was introduced to the possibility of coding in Python within R Studio. Being able to use a second language in R has been really cool, especially as I navigate the differences between R and Python and have learned how they can work together.
An example of the way that R and Python can interact using the Reticulate pacakge is below:</description>

      <description>Introduction With the NFL season in full swing, my obsession with fantasy football has never been stronger. In this project, I will look for any relationships between fantasy football performance and player total contract amount. My first dataset is titled &amp;quot;Football players salaries&amp;quot; and was found on Kaggle. This dataset includes details on NFL players&#39; contracts, including total value, guaranteed money, salary, and player age. My second dataset is titled &amp;quot;Fantasy Football Stats and Season Leaders&amp;quot; and was provided by FantasyData.</description>

      <description>Introduction As an avid sports fan, I was intrigued by this data set that collects data regarding whether or not ownership of a sports souvenir increases its value. The &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; variable represents which good the individual was given, whether it was good A or good B. Good A is a ticket stub from the game that Cal Ripken Jr. set the record for consecutive games played, while Good B was a souvenir from the game that Nolan Ryan won his 300th game.</description>
