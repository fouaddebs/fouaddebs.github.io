description: 'Discussing Python and R Studio'

This semester, we have been almost exclusively working in R studio, as we conducted projects and learned how to code in R. Recently, I was introduced to the possibility of coding in Python within R Studio. Being able to use a second language in R has been really cool, especially as I navigate the differences between R and Python and have learned how they can work together.

An example of the way that R and Python can interact using the Reticulate pacakge is below:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
Lakers<-"The Los Angeles Lakers"
```

The above part is the R code to start the statement: "The Los Angeles Lakers are your 2020 World Champions!" The statement is continued using Python code below and is printed via Python code.

```{python}
Champions="are your 2020 World Champions!"

print(r.Lakers,Champions)
```

Now we use R to print the full message once again. 
```{r}
cat(c(Lakers,py$Champions))
```
As you can see, they are identical and R and Python code can be used simulataneously to create one output.
